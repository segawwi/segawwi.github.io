              There were many weapon innovations in World War I that were useful in battle but the inventions of poisonous gas, the flamethrower, the machine gun, tanks, mortar, etc. Artillery was the most significant leap of the 20th century. The cause for the increase of weapon lethality was the innovation of traditional weapons. On April 22, 1925, <b>poisonous</b> gas was the beginning of gas attacks in World War I. The Germans first filled cylinders with chlorine gas and set them out in the Ypres area. Chlorine gas attacks the respiratory systems and the eyes which causes irritation. The first recorded sign of the <b>flamethrower</b> was with  Germans on February 26, 1915. The tanks were on the backs of the soldiers which used nitrogen pressure to spray the fuel it ignited once it left the muzzle which was a hand-directed pipe.

              There were many <b>machine gun</b> designs but the most were based on Hiram Maxim’s 1884 design. With this design, the machine gun had a sustained fire of 450-600 rounds per minute. Even though the amount of fire was large this weapon was not the most lethal in the war. <b>Tanks</b> were found as far back as the Medieval Era. The first British tank was named “Little Willie” but since it was the first tank there were many flaws, low speed, broke down often, and weighed 14 tons. Throughout the war, tanks were innovated which made them more reliable. <b>Mortars</b> were able to fire up to 22 three-inch shells per minute that can go as far as 1200 yards. This weapon was far more advanced than any of its counterparts at the time.
