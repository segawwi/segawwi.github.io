              <b>Before the War:</b>
              <br> - By the 19th century, most countries granted women suffrage.
              <br> - Working-class women typically worked in factories or as domestically serving the rich.
              <br> - Women's work was thought of as being less important than the men's, despite working with items that were in high demand.
              <br><b>During the War:</b>
              <br> - New jobs popped up for women to fill since their husbands were off at war.
              <br> - Women began working in formerly male-dominated jobs, like ticket collectors, railway guards, officers, firefighters, clerks, etc.
              <br> - Associations such as the Red Cross relied on thousands of female volunteers.
              <br> - Women remained being paid less than men.
              <br> - Thousands also served in the Army Corps or Navy Corps as nurses.
              <br><b>After the War:</b>
              <br> - The men returned to their normal jobs and the women working in those fields declined.
              <br> - Women trying to find real work that utilized their skills were slandered by the press as they "took up ex-servicemen's jobs"
              <br> - Unequality forced them back into working into standard 'women's work', like domestic work & textiling.
